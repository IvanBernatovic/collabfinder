[CollabFinder](https://collabfinder.net) is an open source platform for gathering people with great ideas and matching them together so they can collaborate. You can try out the app on https://app.collabfinder.net.

It is made with Laravel PHP framework and Inertia + Vue. CollabFinder is completely free with no plans whatsoever to go commercial.

## Attention: Collaborators needed

Currently, we would like to find a designer who would contribute a new logo and brand new look and identity.

## Roadmap 2021

-   [ ] new logo and design
-   [ ] public project listing - allow guests to see project if OP decides to make it public
-   [ ] full text search
-   [ ] Twitter profile which automatically shares new project on Twitter
-   [ ] my projects page
-   [ ] custom rules/settings for email notifications so you don't miss out on projects based on a tag or needed role
